    "lyrics": "Misty morning, Clouds in the sky\nWithout warning, A wizard walks by\nCasting his shadow, Weaving his spell\nFlowing clothes, Tinkling bell\n\nNever talking, Just keeps walking\nSpreading his magic\n\nEvil power disappears, Demons worry\nwhen the wizard is near\nHe turns tears into joy\nEveryone’s happy when the wizard walks by\nNever talking, Just keeps walking\nSpreading his magic\n\n                 SOLO2\nSun is shining, Clouds have gone by\nAll the people, Give a happy sigh\nHe has passed by, Giving his sign\nLeft all the people, Feeling so fine\n\nNever talking, Just keeps walking\nSpreading his magic",
